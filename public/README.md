# Public folder – landing background

To show the Gojo vs Sukuna image on the front page:

1. Copy your image file into this `public` folder.
2. Rename it exactly to: **`gojo-sukuna-bg.png`**

The app will use it as the full-screen background. Only the title (呪術廻戦), subtitle (Cursed Energy Experience), and PLAY / EXIT buttons appear in front of the image.

If the file is not here, the front page shows a dark background until you add it.
